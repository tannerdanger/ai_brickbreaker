# ai_brickbreaker

This project was a redesign of my other [Brick Breaker game written in Lua](https://github.com/tannerdanger/Brick_Breaker). I remade this project while studying Javascript and Game Development in order to improve my abilities with both.

This simple game includes an 'AI' that reads the game's state and controls the paddle based on various factors such as ball direction relative to player, quadrant of the playfield the ball is in, etc.

As the game continues, the AI's 'stress level' which is factored into it's calculations. The higher the AI's 'stress level', the greater it's margin for error and therefore, the greater possiblity of mistakes being made.

Note: This 'AI' is not the result of any deep or machine learning, although I do plan on using it for such at a later date.
